# ComfyUI-QwenImageWanBridge

Mostly now just a research set of nodes and Qwen image edit set of nodes for testing diffsynth studio reference code (you dont need to install diffsynth)

## Custom research nodes for qwen2.5-vl with qwen image edit:
Alternative nodes with adherence to diffsynth system prompts and tokens:
- **QwenVLLoader**: Proper Qwen2.5-VL model loader using transformers
- **QwenVLTextEncoder**: Real multimodal text encoder with vision processing
