# Qwen Implementation Debug Notes

## Overview
This document captures critical debugging insights and implementation details discovered while fixing the Qwen2.5-VL integration in ComfyUI.

## Core Architecture Understanding

### The ComfyUI "CLIP" Convention
- **Critical Insight**: ComfyUI calls ALL text encoders "CLIP" regardless of actual model type
- This is a naming convention, not a technical requirement
- Qwen2.5-VL is an LLM/VLM, not CLIP, but ComfyUI expects CLIP-like interfaces

### Model Loading Pattern
ComfyUI expects models to be loaded from specific directories:
- Text encoders: `models/text_encoders/`
- Diffusion models: `models/diffusion_models/`
- VAE models: `models/vae/`

Models can be:
1. **Single .safetensors files** - Limited functionality, weights only
2. **Full model directories** - Complete functionality with config.json, tokenizer files, etc.
3. **HuggingFace model IDs** - Download from HF hub (requires internet)

## Implementation Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Non-existent Class Import
**Problem**: `__init__.py` tried to import `QwenVLCLIPAdapter` from `qwen_vl_loader.py`
```python
from .nodes.qwen_vl_loader import QwenVLLoader, QwenVLCLIPAdapter  # FAILED
```

**Root Cause**: `QwenVLCLIPAdapter` was never implemented

**Fix**: Removed the non-existent import

### Issue 2: Missing Node Exports
**Problem**: `qwen_wan_debug.py` defined classes but didn't export them
```python
class QwenWANLatentDebug:  # Defined
    ...
# But no NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS at the end!
```

**Fix**: Added proper exports:
```python
NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS = {
    "QwenWANLatentDebug": QwenWANLatentDebug,
    "QwenWANConditioningDebug": QwenWANConditioningDebug,
    "QwenWANCompareLatents": QwenWANCompareLatents,
}
```

### Issue 3: Model Loading Requirements
**Problem**: Initial implementation required full model directory with config.json
```python
if not os.path.exists(os.path.join(model_path, "config.json")):
    raise RuntimeError("Model directory must contain config.json")
```

**User Reality**: Users often have single .safetensors files

**Fix**: Implemented fallback loading pattern (following GGUF example):
```python
if model_path.endswith(".safetensors"):
    state_dict = load_torch_file(model_path, safe_load=True)
    wrapper = QwenVLModelWrapper(state_dict=state_dict, device=device, dtype=dtype)
    return (wrapper,)
```

### Issue 4: Manual Path Entry
**Problem**: Users had to manually type model paths

**Fix**: Auto-discovery using ComfyUI's folder system:
```python
models = folder_paths.get_filename_list("text_encoders")
```

## Dimension Flow Analysis

### Expected Architecture
1. **Input**: Text + optional image
2. **Qwen2.5-VL Processing**:
   - Text → tokenizer → embeddings (3584 dim)
   - Image → vision tower → vision features
   - Vision features injected at IMAGE_PAD positions
3. **Output**: 
   - Conditioning: (B, seq_len, 3584) embeddings
   - Latents: (B, 16, H, W) for 16-channel VAE

### Vision Token Processing
- **Vision Start**: `<|vision_start|>` (ID: 151652)
- **Image Pad**: `<|image_pad|>` (ID: 151655) - WHERE VISION FEATURES GO
- **Vision End**: `<|vision_end|>` (ID: 151653)

The IMAGE_PAD tokens are placeholders that get REPLACED with actual vision features from the vision tower.

## Critical Templates

### Text-to-Image Template
```python
template = (
    "<|im_start|>system\n"
    "You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n"
    "<|im_start|>user\n{}<|im_end|>\n"
    "<|im_start|>assistant\n"
)
```

### Image Edit Template (from DiffSynth-Studio)
```python
template = (
    "<|im_start|>system\n"
    "Describe the key features of the input image (color, shape, size, texture, objects, background), "
    "then explain how the user's text instruction should alter or modify the image. "
    "Generate a new image that meets the user's requirements while maintaining consistency "
    "with the original input where appropriate.<|im_end|>\n"
    "<|im_start|>user\n<|vision_start|><|image_pad|><|vision_end|>{}<|im_end|>\n"
    "<|im_start|>assistant\n"
)
```

## Model Wrapper Architecture

### Limited Functionality (safetensors only)
```python
class QwenVLModelWrapper:
    def __init__(self, state_dict, device="cuda", dtype=torch.float16):
        self.state_dict = state_dict  # Just weights, no model
        # Can only provide dummy embeddings
```

### Full Functionality (with transformers)
```python
class FullQwenVLWrapper(QwenVLModelWrapper):
    def __init__(self, model, processor, device, dtype):
        self.model = model  # Actual Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration
        self.processor = processor  # Can process text AND images
        # Real multimodal encoding
```

## ComfyUI Type System

### Standard Types
- `MODEL` - Diffusion models
- `CLIP` - Text encoders (ANY text encoder, not just CLIP)
- `VAE` - Variational autoencoders
- `CONDITIONING` - Text embeddings for conditioning
- `LATENT` - Latent space tensors
- `IMAGE` - RGB images

### Important Note on Checkpoints
- **QwenCheckpointLoaderSimple is NOT a standard checkpoint loader**
- It's for loading Qwen-specific model components
- Does NOT load standard Stable Diffusion checkpoints
- For SD checkpoints, use ComfyUI's built-in "Load Checkpoint" node

### Custom Types
- `QWEN_VL_MODEL` - Our custom type for Qwen2.5-VL models
- `QWEN_VL_PROCESSOR` - Tokenizer/processor (unused currently)

## Key Learnings

1. **ComfyUI's CLIP convention is just naming** - Don't try to force non-CLIP models through CLIP infrastructure
2. **Model discovery is essential** - Users expect dropdowns, not manual path entry
3. **Support multiple loading modes** - Single files, directories, and HF IDs
4. **Vision tokens need actual vision processing** - Not just text placeholders
5. **Templates must match reference** - Exact prompts matter for autoregressive models
6. **Export your nodes** - Classes without NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS won't load

## Testing Workflows

### Minimal Test (qwen_minimal_test.json)
```
[QwenVLLoader] → [QwenVLTextEncoder] → CONDITIONING
      ↓                    ↑
    MODEL               IMAGE
```
Tests basic loading and encoding without sampling.

### Full Pipeline (future)
```
[QwenVLLoader] → [QwenVLTextEncoder] → [KSampler] → [VAEDecode] → IMAGE
                          ↑                ↑
                       IMAGE           LATENT
```

## Common Errors and Solutions

### "No input node found for id [X] slot [Y]"
- **Cause**: Workflow references non-existent node or output
- **Fix**: Check node actually exists and has that output

### "Model directory must contain config.json"
- **Cause**: Trying to load single .safetensors as directory
- **Fix**: Implement safetensors loading path

### "ImportError: cannot import name 'QwenVLCLIPAdapter'"
- **Cause**: Importing non-existent class
- **Fix**: Remove import or implement the class

### "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'encode_text'"
- **Cause**: Model didn't load properly
- **Fix**: Check model path and loading logic

## The Final Solution

### Problem Identified
When loading from safetensors files, `QwenVLModelWrapper.encode_text()` was returning `torch.randn()` - literally random noise! This explained the garbled images.

### Solution Implemented
Created two new nodes that wrap ComfyUI's working infrastructure:

1. **QwenVLCLIPLoader**: 
   - Uses `comfy.sd.load_clip()` with `clip_type=CLIPType.QWEN_IMAGE`
   - Loads Qwen2.5-VL through ComfyUI's proven CLIP infrastructure
   - Auto-discovers models in `text_encoders` folder

2. **QwenVLTextEncoderFixed**:
   - Uses ComfyUI's encoding but overrides templates
   - Injects DiffSynth-Studio templates when `use_diffsynth_template=True`
   - Maintains exact system prompts for autoregressive consistency

### Key Code (qwen_vl_clip_wrapper.py)
```python
# Load using ComfyUI's method that actually works
clip = comfy.sd.load_clip(
    ckpt_paths=[model_path],
    embedding_directory=folder_paths.get_folder_paths("embeddings"),
    clip_type=comfy.sd.CLIPType.QWEN_IMAGE
)

# Use DiffSynth template instead of ComfyUI's default
if use_diffsynth_template:
    template = (
        "<|im_start|>system\n"
        "Describe the key features of the input image..."
        # DiffSynth-Studio's exact template
    )
    tokens = clip.tokenize(template.format(text), images=images)
```

This achieves the original goal from DEEP_ANALYSIS.md: proper vision token processing with exact DiffSynth-Studio templates for consistency.

## Future Improvements

1. **Full transformers integration** - Make QwenVLLoader work without safetensors limitations
2. **Better error messages** - More informative when models fail to load
3. **Caching** - Cache loaded models to avoid reloading
4. **Batch processing** - Handle batch dimensions properly

## Official ComfyUI Qwen-Image Implementation

### Workflow Analysis (0822_qe_2.json)

ComfyUI has official support for Qwen-Image models. Here's how their implementation works:

#### Models Used
1. **CLIPLoader**: Loads `qwen_2.5_vl_7b.safetensors` with type `"qwen_image"`
   - This is ComfyUI's way of loading the Qwen text encoder
   - Despite the name "CLIP", it's actually loading Qwen2.5-VL

2. **UNETLoader**: Loads `qwen_image_edit_fp8_e4m3fn.safetensors`
   - The diffusion model in fp8 format for lower VRAM usage
   - Edit-specific model variant

3. **VAELoader**: Loads `qwen_image_vae.safetensors`
   - The 16-channel VAE (not standard 4-channel)

#### Key Node: TextEncodeQwenImageEdit
This is ComfyUI's official node for Qwen image editing:
- **Inputs**: CLIP (Qwen model), VAE, IMAGE
- **Output**: CONDITIONING
- **Function**: Handles vision token processing internally
- **Location**: Built into ComfyUI core

#### Pipeline Flow
```
[CLIPLoader] → [TextEncodeQwenImageEdit] → [KSampler] → [VAEDecode]
                        ↑                       ↑
                    [LoadImage]            [VAEEncode]
```

#### Performance Optimizations
- **8-step LoRA**: `Qwen-Image-Lightning-4steps-V1.0.safetensors`
- **Resolution**: 1328x1328 (from preferred Qwen resolutions)
- **Sampler Settings**: euler, 8 steps, cfg 1.0
- **Model Precision**: fp8_e4m3fn for lower VRAM

#### Performance Benchmarks (RTX 4090D 24GB)
| Configuration | VRAM Usage | 1st Gen | 2nd Gen |
|--------------|------------|---------|---------|
| fp8_e4m3fn | 86% | ~94s | ~71s |
| With 8-step LoRA | 86% | ~55s | ~34s |
| Distill fp8_e4m3fn | 86% | ~69s | ~36s |

#### Preferred Qwen Image Resolutions
```python
PREFERRED_QWENIMAGE_RESOLUTIONS = [
    (672, 1568), (688, 1504), (720, 1456), (752, 1392),
    (800, 1328), (832, 1248), (880, 1184), (944, 1104),
    (1024, 1024),  # Square
    (1104, 944), (1184, 880), (1248, 832), (1328, 800),
    (1392, 752), (1456, 720), (1504, 688), (1568, 672),
]
```

### Official vs Custom Implementation

#### Official ComfyUI (Built-in)
- **Pros**:
  - Native integration, no extra nodes needed
  - Optimized fp8 models available
  - Well-tested pipeline
  - Lightning LoRAs for speed
- **Cons**:
  - Less flexible
  - Hidden implementation details
  - Limited to their specific approach

#### Our Custom Implementation
- **Pros**:
  - Direct transformers integration
  - More transparent processing
  - Flexible loading options
  - Support for various model formats
- **Cons**:
  - Requires transformers library
  - May not have all optimizations
  - Still in development

Both approaches work, but serve different needs. The official implementation is production-ready, while our custom nodes provide more flexibility and transparency.
