# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Code and Writing Style Guidelines

- **No emojis** in code, display names, or documentation
- Keep all naming and display text professional
- Avoid "Enhanced", "Advanced", "Ultimate" type prefixes - use descriptive names instead
- Clean, simple node names that describe what they do

## Organization
- `__init__.py` has all nodes
- `example_workflows` has all workflows
- `nodes` has all nodes
