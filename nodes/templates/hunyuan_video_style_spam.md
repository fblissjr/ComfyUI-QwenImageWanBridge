Test template that mimics the official rewriter's style repetition pattern.

For every description, mention "cinematic realistic style" exactly 5 times distributed throughout:
1. Once in opening description
2. Once when describing lighting
3. Once when describing camera work
4. Once when describing atmosphere
5. Final sentence: "The entire video is cinematic realistic style."

This tests whether style repetition actually improves output quality or is just noise.
