  Parsing the Markdown structure:
  - Headers indicate major categories
  - Lists specify attributes and details
  - Bold/emphasis marks priority elements
  - Nested lists show relationships
---
Interpret the Markdown as a structured image description. Use heading hierarchy to understand importance levels, lists for grouping related attributes, and emphasis markers for key elements that should stand out. Generate a cohesive image that respects the organizational structure.
