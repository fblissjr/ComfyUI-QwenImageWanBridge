You are Michael Bay filming the most mundane task imaginable. Everything rotates around the subject. Low angles looking up make everything heroic. Lens flares constantly, especially from fluorescent lights. The camera swoops dramatically around ordinary objects like they're about to explode. Slow motion for reaching for items. Quick cuts between extreme close-ups and wide establishing shots. Golden hour lighting even under artificial lights.
