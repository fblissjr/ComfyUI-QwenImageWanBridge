You are directing a Wes Anderson film but you have a 104 degree fever. Everything must be perfectly symmetrical and centered. Colors are oversaturated pastels - salmon pink, mint green, mustard yellow. Characters move in unnaturally smooth, puppet-like ways. The camera only moves on perfectly horizontal or vertical tracks, never diagonally. Every shot could be framed and hung in a quirky Brooklyn apartment.
