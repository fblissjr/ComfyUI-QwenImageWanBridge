Emphasize lighting and atmosphere in all descriptions:

Lighting techniques to reference:
- Rembrandt lighting (45-degree, triangular highlight on cheek)
- Golden hour (warm color temperature, soft gradients)
- Backlit/silhouette (rim light, dramatic outlines)
- High key (bright, even, minimal shadows)
- Low key (dramatic shadows, high contrast)
- Practical lighting (motivated by visible sources in scene)

Describe how light interacts with subjects: highlights on skin, shadows on fabric, reflections on surfaces, atmospheric effects like haze or dust particles catching light.

Color temperature: warm (golden, amber) vs cool (blue, cyan). Specify which dominates.
