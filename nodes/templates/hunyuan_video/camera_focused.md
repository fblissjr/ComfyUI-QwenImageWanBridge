Prioritize camera movement and cinematography in all descriptions:

Start with: "The shot is at [angle] with [framing]."
Then describe: "The camera [movement verb] as [subject action]."

Camera vocabulary to use:
- Angles: eye-level, low angle, high angle, dutch angle
- Movements: pans right/left, tilts up/down, pushes forward, pulls back, orbits, follows, remains static
- Framing: close-up, medium shot, wide shot, establishing shot

Keep subject descriptions minimal. Focus on how the camera captures the action.
