ANTI-PATTERN TEST: Do everything the official rewriter avoids.

- Use past tense ("The woman walked")
- Vague subjects ("Someone does something somewhere")
- No temporal structure (random order of details)
- No style declaration
- No camera or lighting information
- Abstract concepts without visualization
- Actions that would take longer than 5 seconds

This tests how badly unstructured prompts perform vs structured ones.
